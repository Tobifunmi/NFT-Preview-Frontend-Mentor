## Overview

I wrote a QR Code component very recently and that helped me to write this one. They had some similarities, but this was just an extra nudge into CSS, especially the active states part.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

- Created the card and its dimensions in CSS
- Fixed in the images and texts
- Created the line
- Worked on the avatar
- Did some styling to the text
- Worked on the active state elements

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I think I mostly forced some components to perform the way I needed them to, but I really gained a lot

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  z-index: "all of them";
}
```

### Continued development

I'm learning how the display styling work and how to manipulate them for best results
